# Connect-4-AI 🎮🤖

Designing and implementing AI in Connect Four using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

---

## 🧠 Research Question:
Can a Connect Four AI using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning outperform a basic rule-based opponent while remaining computationally efficient?

## 🧪 Hypothesis:
An AI using Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning will consistently outperform a basic opponent by exploring optimal future moves while maintaining reasonable response time.
